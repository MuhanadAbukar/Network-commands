10. "tracert" - This command is used to trace the path of packets from the local host to a specified destination host. It sends an ICMP echo request packet to the destination host and listens for the ICMP time exceeded in transit and echo reply packets. The command can be used with the IP address or hostname of the destination host. Example: "tracert google.com" will display a list of intermediate network devices that a packet takes to reach the website "google.com".
